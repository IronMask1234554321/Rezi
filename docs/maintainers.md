# Maintaining docs

Docs goals:

- Every public concept has a landing page.
- Widget pages are accurate and link to the typed API.
- Development-only notes stay out of user-facing guides.

Practical checklist for changes:

- Update the manual for any user-facing behavior change.
- Keep examples runnable and referenced by docs.
- Run `bash scripts/docs.sh build` before publishing.
