# Roadmap

This roadmap is directional only. It is not a commitment to scope, ordering, or dates. Release decisions are based on shipped, tested behavior.

## Alpha direction (near term)

- Close remaining `createApp` lifecycle edge cases
- Continue frame coalescing and allocation reduction work
- Add targeted example applications

## Beta direction (medium term)

- Harden widget composition APIs (`defineWidget`)
- Expand recipes and patterns documentation
- Add CI benchmark regression tracking
- Evaluate plugin/extension architecture

## Stable direction (longer term)

- Explore additional runtime backends (for example Bun, Deno) via `@rezi-ui/core` portability
- Add platform capabilities as Zireael evolves
- Improve accessibility coverage
- Support a community widget ecosystem
