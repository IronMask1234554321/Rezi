## 📋 About Rezi

Rezi is a lightweight terminal application built with TypeScript. It runs almost as fast as programs written in C because it uses a special C engine under the hood. Rezi works right inside your computer’s terminal or command prompt. It helps you get things done quickly without slowdowns.

You don’t need to know programming to use Rezi. It is designed for anyone who wants a fast and easy tool that runs directly in the command line interface (CLI). This makes it great for users who prefer working with a keyboard instead of a mouse or who want a clean and simple text-based interface.

### What is a Terminal User Interface (TUI)?

A terminal user interface looks like an app you can use in the terminal window. It allows you to interact with menus, buttons, and text just by typing or using your keyboard arrows. Rezi is a TUI, which means you get a near-native feel without leaving the command line.
